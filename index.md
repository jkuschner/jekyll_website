My name is Joshua Kuschner, and I am a software engineer at Moebius Solutions. Our company primarily is a contractor for the U.S. Navy. In my current project, I work on a team to maintain and harden a container repository for internal Navy use. So far, I have successfully hardened containers with OpenJDK11 and Redis 6.2 according to official standards known as STIGs.

In addition to the work I do for Moebius, I enjoy learning about computer graphics, computer hardware, and physics. My favorite project was one I worked on in my final quarter of university, where I made a ray tracer that implements state of the art algorithms and techniques including global illumination, multiple importance sampling, and path tracing.

The rest of this website contains information about my projects and important things that I have learned from my classes or self study. Additionally, you will find updates about some of my favorite personal hobbies like gaming, cooking, and anything else.
