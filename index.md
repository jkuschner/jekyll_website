My name is Joshua Kuschner. I am a dedicated software engineer with a strong foundation in computer science with a Bachelor's degree from UCSD. I have a keen eye for detail and a knack for crafting efficient solutions, I continued to hone my skills through practical experience at Moebius Solutions.

Driven by a lifelong curiosity and a commitment to professional growth, I am constantly seeking new opportunities to expand my skillset. My recent focus has been on deepening my understanding of full-stack web development, which I have been actively pursuing through a variety of personal projects. You can explore some of these projects in detail on my website.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I find joy in exploring my passions. Whether it's experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen or hitting the tennis court for a competitive match, my hobbies allow me to maintain a balanced and fulfilling life.
