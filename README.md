This is my personal website showcasing who I am in a professional sense as well as some of my personal hobbies.

It contains a brief summary of me at the homepage. It will also contain any projects that I work on and my reflections on them. I intend to document the core ideas and my reflections to core classes that I take or anything else that I learn in the notes section. Finally, the Interests section will contain a blog of any hobbies that I wish to share. It will most likely be largely populated with some details on my gaming endeavors.
