        <h2>JISCTF 2020 Writeup</h2>
        <h4>27 Nov 2020</h4>
        <p>This was my first ever CTF challenge, and I only knew I would be participating the day before the event. Nevertheless, it sounded like some fun hacking time with my friends.</p>

<p>In the end, I was able to find 2 flags, both involving the inspection of <code>.pcapng</code> files that contain network packets. The first flag I found was aptly named, So Easy. All I had to do was inspect the given <code>easy.pcapng</code> file using WireShark. More precisely, I exported all HTTP objects from the file to find that there was a <code>login.php</code> file in plain HTML text, so I navigated over to that packed and followed to TCP stream to get the HTML text to find the flag in the username field.</p>

<p><img src="/images/image-20201121102459292.png" alt="image-20201121102459292" style="zoom:150%;" /></p>

<p>The second challenge I completed was significantly more difficult, but started the same way. I examined the provided <code>colurfull.pcapng</code> file using WireShark. After looking through the traffic and finding nothing of value, I then looked to the FTP traffic. There we found that the attacker sent a <code>files.zip</code> file to the server.</p>

<p><img src="/images/image-20201127133403856.png" alt="image-20201127133403856" /></p>

<p>I calculated the port to be 256 * 180 + 127 = 46207 and filtered all of the traffic by that port number to find the file that the attacker sent. By following that TCP stream, we found the following zip file:</p>

<p><img src="/images/image-20201127134712487.png" alt="image-20201127134712487" /></p>

<p>Since this starts with “PK” I know that it is a .zip file, so I saved it to my local as raw bytes only to find that it has been encrypted with a password!</p>

<p><img src="/images/image-20201127140306990.png" alt="image-20201127140306990" /></p>

<p>To try to crack this password, I want to get a hash of it, so I can try to look up the original password in a table. As it turns out, I found the password to be “labeba”</p>

<p><img src="/images/image-20201127140550101.png" alt="image-20201127140550101" /></p>

<p>Finally! The file, <code>secret_data.txt</code> has been extracted successfully. Surely this will contain the flag.</p>

<p><img src="/images/image-20201127140923659.png" alt="image-20201127140923659" /></p>

<p>What’s all this? It surely isn’t a flag, but it must be something. There are a lot more lines than this, and they are not all the same set of numbers. What could all of this data mean? Hmm… sets of 3 numbers, several of them repeating, none of them are greater than 255… that’s it! They must be pixel data that represents an image. The flag must be close. All I need to do is somehow convert all of this data into an actual image. It’s time to put my scripting skills to the test. Luckily, the Python PIL library was made just for this. The <code>frombytes()</code> function takes the size of the image, and the image data as raw bytes to create an <code>Image</code> object which can easily be converted to a <code>.png</code> file. There are 10693 lines of data in the <code>secret_data.txt</code> file which factors to $17^2\times 37$, so there are only a few possibilities for the size of the image. Now I need to convert the image data given as ASCII into raw bytes and feed them into the script, trying the different image sizes until we get an image that looks like something useful. The final script looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/image-20201127142336446.png" alt="image-20201127142336446" /></p>

<p>This wonderful script produced the following image:</p>

<p><img src="/images/image-20201127142414612.png" alt="image-20201127142414612" /></p>

<p>Sweet success!!</p>

        <h2>The Very Beginning</h2>
        <h4>30 Jul 2020</h4>
        <p>Fresh off the boat from Tutorial Island as an up and coming Ironman, I used
OzrisRS’s <a href="https://pastebin.com/0xGyuk5r">guide</a> to get an efficient start to my account. I planned to use the guide to get my pair of <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Barrows_gloves">Barrows gloves</a>, a key initial milestone for any new account, Ironman or otherwise.</p>

<p>For more information on why Barrows gloves are important start to any account, click <em>here</em>.</p>

<p>Barrows gloves are essential the reward for completing the <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Recipe_for_Disaster">Recipe For Disaster</a> quest which consists of eight different subquests. In each of these you must save various NPCs from around the world from the evil <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Culinaromancer">Culinaromancer</a>. Once you have completed all of the subquests, you must face the Culinaromancer head on and defeat him. Once you are done, you finally get access to the coveted Barrows gloves, one of the most powerful pairs of gloves in the entire game.</p>

<p>In its entirety, Recipe For Disaster(RFD) has a hefty amount of prerequisites, so while working toward the completion of the quest, I would be improving a lot of my stats and completing other important quests.</p>

<h3 id="wintertodt">Wintertodt</h3>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/Wintertodt.png" width="450" class="inlinephoto_right" /></p>

<p>Before I could start on my questing journey, I needed to spend some time assisting the pyromancers in containing the <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Wintertodt">Wintertodt</a>. Fighting the Wintertodt is one of the best ways to train the <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Firemaking">Firemaking</a> skill while also getting valuable supplies as rewards. I want to do this while I am low level, because the minigame does damage based on my maximum health. Therefore, it is much easier to do with only 10 hitpoints because my food(which heals me) is more valuable.</p>

<p>Wintertodt can also yield some unique rewards including the <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pyromancer_outfit">Pyromancer outfit</a>, the <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Phoenix">Phoenix</a> pet, and, most importantly, the <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Tome_of_fire">Tome of fire</a>. This tome can be equipped in the offhand slot, and when it is charged with <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Burnt_page">burnt pages</a>, it provides an infinite source of fire runes and amplifies the damage of all fire spells by 50%.</p>

<p>And so I toiled away at the pyromancer’s braziers until I reached 75 Firemaking. I had enough levels for now, so I moved on to some quests that would ultimately set me up for some new long training sessions.</p>

<p>In my next post, I’ll tell the tale of how I mastered the <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Thieving">Thieving</a> skill and greatly improved my <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fishing">Fishing</a> and <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Agility">Agility</a> skills.</p>

        <h2>This is my Ironman</h2>
        <h4>02 Jul 2020</h4>
        <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/Ironman_wave.png" width="400" class="inlinephoto_left" /></p>

<p>This is my character in one of my favorite video games, Old School Runescape. Runescape is an MMORPG that was first released in 2001 and has gone through a few major game engine changes since then. The version of the game that I play now is a reprise of the 2007 version(hence <em>Old School</em> Runescape).</p>

<p>I first started playing the game with my two brothers when I was 6 years old, and I continued playing up until I started high school. I started playing again after I graduated from high school in 2016, and the version I had played when I was younger had become the Old School version.</p>

<p>This is when I really got into the game. I enjoyed the game so much that I decided to make an Ironman account, an account with a simple restriction: you may not trade items with other players in any way. For a normal account, anytime that you want an weapon, piece of armor, or any other item you want, you can buy it off of the <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Grand_Exchange">Grand Exchange</a> with the in-game currency. Therefore, the bulk of your time spent is on the single piece of content that makes the most money. However, for an Ironman account, you must get every item from its true source in the game. This essentially turns a game that was already considered a <em>grindy</em> game into one that is even more so.</p>

<p>Since the birth of this account on February 13, 2018 I have grinded out so many different parts of the game like <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Wintertodt">Wintertodt</a>, <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pest_Control">Pest Control</a>, <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Cerberus">Cerberus</a>, <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Zulrah">Zulrah</a>, <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Demonic_gorilla">Demonic Gorrilias</a>, and much more. Even after all of that, there is still so much for me to get with this account. In future posts, I plan to recap the progress I’ve made on my account in more detail, and then provide current updates on my progress. Stick around if you are new and want to learn more about the game, or if you’re more seasoned and want to pick up some Ironman tips and tricks, or even if you don’t play the game and just want to follow me on my journey.</p>
