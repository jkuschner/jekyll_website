        <h2>This is my Ironman</h2>
        <h4>02 Jul 2020</h4>
        <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/Ironman_wave.png" width="400" class="inlinephoto_left" /></p>

<p>This is my character in one of my favorite video games, Old School Runescape. Runescape is an MMORPG that was first released in 2001 and has gone through a few major game engine changes since then. The version of the game that I play now is a reprise of the 2007 version(hence <em>Old School</em> Runescape).</p>

<p>I first started playing the game with my two brothers when I was 6 years old, and I continued playing up until I started high school. I started playing again after I graduated from high school in 2016, and the version I had played when I was younger had become the Old School version.</p>

<p>This is when I really got into the game. I enjoyed the game so much that I decided to make an Ironman account, an account with a simple restriction: you may not trade items with other players in any way. For a normal account, anytime that you want an weapon, piece of armor, or any other item you want, you can buy it off of the <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Grand_Exchange">Grand Exchange</a> with the in-game currency. Therefore, the bulk of your time spent is on the single piece of content that makes the most money. However, for an Ironman account, you must get every item from its true source in the game. This essentially turns a game that was already considered a <em>grindy</em> game into one that is even more so.</p>

<p>Since the birth of this account on February 13, 2018 I have grinded out so many different parts of the game like <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Wintertodt">Wintertodt</a>, <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pest_Control">Pest Control</a>, <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Cerberus">Cerberus</a>, <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Zulrah">Zulrah</a>, <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Demonic_gorilla">Demonic Gorrilias</a>, and much more. Even after all of that, there is still so much for me to get with this account. In future posts, I plan to recap the progress I’ve made on my account in more detail, and then provide current updates on my progress. Stick around if you are new and want to learn more about the game, or if you’re more seasoned and want to pick up some Ironman tips and tricks, or even if you don’t play the game and just want to follow me on my journey.</p>
