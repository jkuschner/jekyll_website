A Java based web application built with SpringBoot that stores workout data in a PostgreSQL database. The API supports CRUD operations with a set of workouts personalized to the types of workouts I enjoy such as tennis, swimming, lifting, and yoga. The app helps me keep track of my workouts throughout the week and meet my fitness goals.
