title: Developing Course Material for Theory of Computation

I will be working closely with two of my classmates at UCSD to develop and edit course content for [Prof. Minnes's](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~minnes/) online Theory of Computation class. 

Due to the recent pandemic, all university classes were fully remote during the spring quarter, and they will remain mostly remote for the foreseeable future. Therefore, it is our job to make the course content easier to digest and understand in a remote format.
